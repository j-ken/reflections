What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you 
need to do it?
---
I need this to make git aware that I want to track this folder
location with all the files contained in it.

----------

How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
---
the staging area is a temporary buffer memory. it contains 
files we added with git add, but aren't yet committed.
the working directory is where our current files are saved, 
all changes made to the files are seen here. the repository
will mirror the changes made in the working directory, but only
if we tell it to do so via git commit.
so the order in actuality of the three concepts would be
1. working directory (contains all files up to date)
2. staging area (when we add files they are here)
3. repository (when we commit changes, they will be here)
